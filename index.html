          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named 
          Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late 
          with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
              </p>
              <p>
          He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that 
          should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made 
          the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic 
          evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a 
          repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a 
          prodigiously violent instant.
              </p>
              <p>
          If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look 
          uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous 
          ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles 
          were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
              </p>
              <p>
          “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a 
          double box around it.
              </p>
              <p>
          On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had 
          seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically 
          as inflation, looked right.
              </p>
              <p>
          Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic 
          time</a> with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. 
          Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the 
          fabric of space-time — so-called <a href="#">gravitational waves</a> — the signature 
          of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of 
          a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun 
          evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was 
          correct.

        <p>
        Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including 
        Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
        </p>
        <p>
        If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the 
        recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It 
        would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
        </p>
        <p>
        Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years 
        in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a 
        larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our 
        own universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy 
        eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
        </p>
      <h4>‘As Big as It Gets’</h4>
        <p>
        In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies 
        forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into 
        gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational 
        waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-
        time.
        </p>
        <p>
        Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of 
        the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
        </p>
        <p>
        He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded 
        in gravitational waves.”
        </p>
        <p>
        The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave 
        radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 
        380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.
        </p>
        <p>
        Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for 
        Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in 
        a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of 
        papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

      <h3>The Theory of Inflation</h3>
      <p>Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains 
        how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big 
        Bang 13.8 billion years ago.</p>

      <div class="theorytext">
        <div class="cell1">
          <p><strong>THE UNIVERSE</strong>  is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky 
            Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across
            . But there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cell2">
          <p>
            <strong>NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong>  The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled the 
            vast distance from one side of the universe to the other, and there has not been 
            enough time for scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cell3">
          <p>
            <strong>DISTANT COFFEE</strong>  At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a mile in 
            one direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can 
            estimate its temperature and how much it has cooled.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cell4">
          <p>
            <strong>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</strong>  Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You 
            see a similar coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. 
            But if you see a similar cup in every direction, you might want to look for 
            another explanation.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cell5">
          <p>
            <strong>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong>  There has not been enough time to carry coffee 
              cups from place to place before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were 
              somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all at the same time, that might 
              explain their even temperature.
          </p>
        </div>

          <div class="cell6">
            <p>
              <strong>INFLATION</strong>  solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a 
                trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than 
                the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy field 
                eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the universe.
            </p>
          </div>

            <div class="cell7">
              <p>
                <strong>FLUCTUATION</strong>  Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient 
                  fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background 
                  radiation, which is energy left over from the early universe. These are 
                  gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.
              </p>
            </div>

              <div class="cell8">
                <p>
                  <strong>EXPANSION</strong>  Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot 
                    expanding faster than light and cooling to an even temperature as it 
                    expands. That is something like inflation. And the structure of the 
                    universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.

        Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one 
        in 10 million.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had 
        not expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>
        The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ 
        worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a 
        leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select 
        few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts 
        Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that 
        night in 1979), in his office last week.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as 
        scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as 
        he tended his radio telescopes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described 
        the most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, 
        in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when 
        Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, 
        <a href="#">knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne</a> to tell him the news.

        Stanford Professor Andrei Linde celebrates physics breakthrough.
        <span>Video by StanfordUniversity</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had 
        ordered anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this 
        was a delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything, 
        but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” 
        Dr. Linde wrote in an email.
      </p>
      <p>
        Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said 
        he was still hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best 
        way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.
      </p>
      <p>
        By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that 
        inflation had been seen and news spread, astrophysicists 
        responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think 
        that if this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest 
        discoveries in the history of science.”
      </p>
      <p>
        John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s 
        mentor and head of a competing project called the South Pole 
        Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the 
        results are beautiful and very convincing,” he said.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to 
        inflation that posits the clash of a pair of universes as the 
        cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would 
        eliminate his model, but he expressed reservations about 
        inflation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized 
        the need for confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded 
        earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic 
        background by the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and 
        other assumptions about the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
        “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr.
         Krauss said.
      </p>
      <p>
        Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft 
        will report its own findings this year. At least a dozen other 
        teams are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops 
        and space.
      </p>
      <h3>Spirals in the Sky</h3>
      <p>
        Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the 
        cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno 
        Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the 
        Nobel Prize.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of 
        these waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has 
        operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at 
        the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing 
        conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of 
        Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology 
        and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be 
        on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he 
        said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he 
        said.
      </p>

      <p class="piccapt iframecapt">
        The Bicep2 telescope, in the foreground, was used to detect the 
        faint spiraling gravity patterns — the signature of a universe 
        being wrenched violently apart at its birth. <span>Steffen Richter/Associated Press</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was 
        polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one 
        direction rather than another.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves 
        from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in 
        another as they go by, would twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves, 
        theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have little 
        arrows going in spirals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the 
        temperature of the microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant 
        superconducting thermometer.
      </p>
      <p>
        “We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.
      </p>
      <p>
        The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning 
        up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying 
        that competitors might beat them to the breakthrough.
      </p>
      <h3>A Special Time</h3>
      <p>
        The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, 
        staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break 
        point in the evolution of the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity, 
        electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces. But they have long suspected 
        that those are simply different manifestations of a single unified force that ruled 
        the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, 
        like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The 
        laws of physics evolved, with one force after another splitting away.
      </p>
      <p>
        That was where Dr. Guth came in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature 
        falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly 
        freeze, releasing latent heat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long. In 
        that case, space itself would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of 
        antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up. Since it was space itself 
        supplying the repulsive force, the more space was created, the harder it pushed 
        apart.
      </p>
      <p>
        What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion 
        trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a 
        grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.
      </p>
      <p>
        Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and 
        radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s 
        observable universe, a patch of sky and stars billions of light-years across. 
        “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to 
        say, “but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. 
        Guth’s original vision suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as 
        our own universe settled down to a comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the 
        cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept 
        known as the multiverse.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking 
        about going any deeper into the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because 
        inflation erases everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of 
        the primordial moment are swept away, forever out of our view.
      </p>
      <p>
        “If you trace your cosmic roots”, said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer 
        who was not part of the team, “you wind up at inflation”.
